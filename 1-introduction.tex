\subsection{Casimir energy}

The Casimir force is an attractive force that arises due to fluctuations in quantum fields.  It was first predicted in 1948 by Henrik Casimir~\cite{Casimir1948}.  If we consider two planar perfect conductors, we find that there is an attractive force between them due to the zero point energy of the electromagnetic field.  In a quantum electrodynamics the ground state of each mode of the electromagnetic field contributes $\hbar\omega/2$, where $\hbar$ is Planck's constant, and $\omega$ is the frequency of the mode.  The presence of the conductors forces the electric field to vanish on the surfaces, which restricts the allowed modes of the electromagnetic field. If we add up the energy from all modes of the electromagnetic field, and compare it to the case when the plates are infinitely far apart from one another, we find the energy is reduced as the plates are brought closer together.  The energy between the plates is then
\begin{equation}
  E = -\frac{\hbar c}{240\pi^2 d^3},
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $d$ is the distance between the plates.

\subsection{Casimir-Polder energy}

The Casimir force is also important for atoms near surfaces.  This variant is known as the Casimir-Polder force, after a paper by Casimir and Polder where they computed the force between an atom and a perfect conductor accounting for the finite speed of light~\cite{CasimirPolder1948}.  
In this case, the atom feels an attractive potential to a surface a distance $d$ away,
\begin{equation}
V_{CP} =-\frac{3\hbar c\alpha_0}{64\pi^2\epsilon_0 d^4}.
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assuming electrically neutral
\item Far from atomic separations, so continuum approximation acceptable.
\end{itemize}

\item Casimir forces are short ranged forces and decay away quickly.  The Coulomb potential between charged particles is behaves as $d^{-1}$, where $d$ is the particles separation.  In comparison, the London dispersive force between two atoms decays as $d^{-7}$.  For macroscopic bodies, the decay is slower, since we can roughly think of adding up the contributions from all of the constituent atoms.  For Casimir energies, the energy decays as $d^{-3}$.  

These considerations are for zero temperature.  It turns out that considering the effects of finite temperature, in particular thermal photons, leads to different distance dependence again.  The energies typically decay more slowly in the high temperature limit.  If the Casimir force decays as $d^{-n}$ at zero temperature, then we typically find that the force decays as $r^{-n+1}$ at high temperatures.  

We can estimate typical distance scales by considering the dominant resonances of the medium, and the thermal wavelength.  So the Casimir force is typically then important at distances below the transition wavelength which is usually around $1\mu m$.    

\item The typical energy scale can also be estimated.  If we consider an atom with a static polarizability of $\comment{polarizability}$, at a distance of $1\mu m$, we find the Casimir-Polder potential is \ldots. 

For macroscopic bodies we can compare the Casimir energy for perfect metal conductors at a distance $d$ to the energy stored in the capacitance.  Note that we compute an energy per unit area.  

The Casimir energy per unit area is $\frac{\hbar c\pi^2}{240 d^3}$, while the voltage for a parallel plate capacitor is.
\begin{shaded}
\begin{itemize}
\item Capacitance is $V=Q/C$.  
\item $C = \epsilon_0 A/d$.  
\item Energy is $\frac{1}{2}CV^2=\frac{Q^2}{2C} $
\end{itemize}

%\item Cite Casimir/Casimir-Polder and Lifshitz.
\item Casimir vs Van Der Waals vs London Forces

The Casimir force is intimately related to the van der Waals forces between molecules.  Van der Waals forces are usually ascribed to the dipole fluctuations of the neutral atoms.  In the limit where the atoms are far apart retardation becomes important and the force changes decays more quickly as $r^{-7}$.  In this limit the forces are sometimes referred to as London dispersion forces.  Normally Casimir forces consider the 

Throughout this thesis we shall use Casimir forces to refer to the forces between macroscopic bodies, and Casimir-Polder forces to refer to the forces between atoms and macroscopic bodies.  

\item Renormalization

As QED calculation, the Casimir energy is formally divergent and must be renormalized.  In our case, we typically energy differences when one of the bodies is removed to spatial infinity.  In some cases, like spheres we must consider renormalization more carefully.  In those cases, the formally infinite parameters we get renormalize the physical parameters of the model~\cite{Miltonbook2001}.  

\item Non-additivity of forces:  Reference for this?  What is the typical scale of the correction for non-additivity?

\item Search for repulsive forces

\begin{itemize}
\item Casimir force important for stiction.
\item Attracts atoms, sets lower bound for how close you can get particles together.
\item Search for repulsive forces as possible trapping (Motivation for this?)
\item Can be found for magnetic media (but typically small).  Metamaterials exhibit this for small range of frequencies.  But Casimir broadband, and dielectric contribution ends up dominating.  (\comment{ Cite Milonni on metametarials}.Sufficiently anistropic dielectric media (how anisotropic? \comment{Cite Milton}) $\epsilon_1<\epsilon_3<\epsilon_2$ over a broad enough range of frequencies \comment{Cite Lifshitz of liquid helium.  Cite experiments, and note odd fluids.}.   Geometries dependence (\comment{Cite reid paper on needle above hole}).

\subsection{Worldlines}

The worldline method is an alternative method for computing Casimir energies.  The worldline method was initially developed as an alternative method for carrying out QFT calculations in terms of particle mechanics~\cite{McKeon1993, Strassler1992,Schubert2001}.  In particular we can compute compute quantum effective actions in terms of the suitable dynamics of a quantum particle.  \comment{Other references - was one contemporaneous with Strassler? Bern-Kosower}

The basic insight is that for one loop effective actions, we can recast a field path integral calculation in terms of the particle path integral for particles travelling in closed space-time loops.  This is quite similar to the scalar electrodynamics Feynman explored in his Ph.D thesis~\cite{Feynman1942, Brown2005}\comment{Seems to actually be his 1950 QED paper RE Schubert2001}.  Higher order loop calculations can also be carried out with more particles, and gauge fields can also be treated~\cite{Schubert2001}.  For example, the worldline method has been used to compute relativistic field effects for QED such as the Lamb shift~\cite{Schmidt1995}.  It has also been used as a numerical algorithm\cite{Mazur2014}.

The worldline method is heavily based on Feynman's path integral method~\cite{Feynman1948,Feynman1965}.

Our primary interest in the worldline method is for computing Casimir energies, which can be cast as effective actions.  The worldline was first used for the Casimir energy by Gies\etal~\cite{Gies2003,Gies2006, Gies2006a}.  While the initial work focused on the zero temperature limit, the worldline method has also been extended to finite temperatures~\cite{Klingmueller2008}.  This has also been used to study the torsion of inclined planes~\cite{Weber2009}, and planes and spheres and planes and cylinders~\cite{Weber2010, Weber2010a}.  

We will briefly introduce the method here, and discuss the method at length in Ch.~\ref{ch:scalar_worldlines}.  Let the action for the scalar field be given by 
\begin{equation}
  S = \int_0^T dt \int d^3x \left[ (\partial_t\phi)^2-(\nabla\phi)^2-V(\vect{x},t)\phi^2\right],
\end{equation}
where $V(\vect{x},t)$ defines the surfaces of the objects we wish to compute the Casimir energy between.  The potential is typically chosen to be $V(\vect{x},t)=\lambda\delta[\sigma(\vect{x})]$, where $\sigma(\vect{x})=0$ defines the surfaces.  In the limit $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$ the potential enforces Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $\phi(\vect{x})\big|_{\sigma(\vect{x})=0} =0$.  This corresponds to assuming the surfaces are idealized perfect conductors.  

We can compute the partition function for the field by Wick rotating to imaginary time (or finite temperature), where the partition function is now given by 
\begin{equation}
  Z = \int D\phi \exp\left\{-\int_0^T dt \int d^3x \left[ (\partial_t\phi)^2+(\nabla\phi)^2+V(\vect{x},t)\phi^2\right]\right\},
\end{equation}
The Gaussian integration over fields can be carried out as a functional determinant.  In order to compute the energy we need the logarithm of the partition function, and various derivatives of it.  The end result of these manipulations is that the renormalized energy can be written as 
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{scalar}} = \frac{\hbar c}{(2\pi)^{D/2}}\int_0^\infty \frac{d\cT}{\cT^{1+D/2}} \int d\vect{x} \dlangle e^{-\cT\langle V\rangle} -1\drangle,
\end{equation}
where $\cT$ is the loop ``time'' and governs the extent of the loops, $\vect{x}_0$ is the loop starting point, $\dlangle \cdots\drangle$ denotes an ensemble average over closed Gaussian random walks, and $\langle\cdots\rangle$ denotes the average of a quantity around the loop.
