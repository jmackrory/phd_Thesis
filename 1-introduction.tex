\chapter{Introduction}

%suggest some unity to two disparate projects.  
Quantum mechanics is fundamentally a statistical theory, in that it only makes predictions for 
the probabilities of events~\cite{Sakurai1994}.
The probability for an event to occur is given by the Born rule, which says the probability is given by 
the absolute-square of the probability amplitude for that event.  
If there are multiple pathways by which an event can take place, the total amplitude for an event is 
the sum over the amplitudes for each possible pathways~\cite{Feynman1965}.  
These paths encompass paths through abstract spaces, such as the number of excitations in a field.
In this case, the intermediate particles correspond to are referred to as ``virtual particles'', 
which are referred to as quantum fluctuations.
This sum over intermediate amplitudes can lead to novel quantum effects such as the Casimir effect,
where electrically neutral, material bodies are attracted to each other due to the exchange of virtual photons.
%\comment{Perhaps Peres?}

Alternatively, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics implies that the results of quantum measurements 
are stochastic quantities which fluctuate under repeated measurements.  
This is particularly relevant as modern experiments can isolate single quantum systems for long 
periods of time and continuously measure their properties.  One can then think of reconstructing
the system's trajectory through time as it evolves based on the measurement~\cite{Carmichael1993}.  

This thesis presents two projects reflecting each aspect of quantum fluctuations.  
The projects are further connected by their quantum mechanical underpinning, the computational methods 
employed to simulate stochastic processes, and their relevance to modern experiments on atoms.  
The first project is a method of computing energies related to Casimir effect, while the second project is related to 
continuous quantum position measurements of atoms.  The majority of this thesis will be devoted
to the first project, with the second project being discussed in the final chapter.  
The key results presented in this thesis have been published in~\cite{
Mackrory2010, Mackrory2016,Mackrory2017a, Mackrory2017b}
% Through advances in modern experimental technology both of these categories of effect are now

\section{Casimir Forces}% in general and physical interpretation}

The Casimir force is a primarily attractive force that arises between material bodies interacting via 
quantized fields.
The most important example of the Casimir effect is due to fluctuations in the electromagnetic (EM) field, 
where one can think of the electrons in a body emitting and absorbing virtual photons that can interact
with other bodies.  The interacting bodies can be pairs of atoms, 
macroscopic bodies such as metallic planes, or atoms and macrosopic bodies.
Alternatively, the Casimir effect can be attributed to the attraction between instantaneous dipoles forming.  
This interpretation is intimately related to the van der Waals force, where 
molecules with fluctuating dipole moments are attracted to one another.

\todo{Seems to choppy - should expand on classic Casimir computation as an example.}

The resulting attractive potential for bodies separated by a distance $d$ is a power law.
For pairs of macroscopic bodies the energy scales as $d^{-2}--d^{-3}$ for macroscopic bodies, 
while the energy scales as $d^{-6}--d^{-7}$ for pairs of atoms.  
The Casimir effect is important at distances around the resonant
wavelengths of the atom or medium, which are typically on the order of $1\mu$m for optical transitions.  
The Casimir effect is typically computed in a long-wavelength limit where the bodies can be treated 
as distinct from one another, or treat the material as being fixed.
This long-wavelength limit also corresponds to energies small compared to the binding energies of the bodies.
This approximation starts to break down for distances on the scale of the separation of the constituent atoms,
which is around $1\mathrm{\AA}$.  In addition, beyond distances of around $10 \mu$m, the Casimir effect is too
weak to detect.  

For comparison, the Casimir effect is short-ranged compared to the $d^{-1}$ Coulumb potential between charged particles.
However, most bodies are electrically neutral and thus have no long-ranged Coulomb potential, whereas
the Casimir effect applies even if the bodies have no net charge.

Beyond their importance as manifestations of quantum field theory, Casimir effects are also 
important to a range of modern experiments and developing technologies.  Some of these experiments 
will be discussed further in Sec.~\ref{sec:expt_review}.  In order to describe these experiments,
a number of theoretical and computational approaches have been developed.  The most important of
these modern methods are the so-called ``scattering method'' and ``worldline methods''.
To date, the scattering method is the only general purpose numerical method available for computing
Casimir forces in arbitrary arrangements of bodies, while this thesis aims to expand upon the worldline method.  
In Sec.~\ref{sec:numerical_review} we will briefly discuss these methods.  

At the outset, we note that there have been a number of books published on the subject of Casimir forces 
in recent years.  This reflects the importance of Casimir forces to both physicists and chemists, as 
well as the advent of new experiments which have spurred the development of new theoretical methods.  
Milonni's clear text on QED sets the Casimir force in context as one manifestation of the quantized theory of light~\cite{Milonni1994}.
while Milton's text emphasizes using Green function methods for computing a number of consequences for 
the Casimir effect for various fields, dimensions~\cite{Milton2001}.  There have been more recent
where the state-of-the-art in both theory and experiments is discussed by practitioners --- 
notably in the volumes by Bordag~\etal\cite{Bordag2009}, 
and the collection editted by Dalvit~\etal\cite{Dalvit2011}.  
\todo{Cite Vogel and Welsch~\cite{VogelWelsch2006}.  Also cite Buhmann~\cite{Buhmann2012-vol1,Buhmann2012-vol2}}
While this thesis emphasizes simple physical applications, the application of Casimir or 
van der Waals forces is also important to problems in surface physics and chemistry, as discussed in the texts by 
 Parsegian~\cite{Parsegian2006} and Israelachivili~\etal~\cite{Israelachvili2011}.

The references in the following sections are given to emphasize the important results and calculations
and set the basic context for Casimir effects.   In addition we will often use these results 
as checks in our later work.  Broader bibliographic surveys of the (vast) Casimir literature
are available from Milton~\cite{Milton-bib} and Babb~\cite{Babb-bib}.

\subsection{Atomic Forces}

In his 1873 Ph.~D thesis van der Waals found deviations from ideal gas behaviour~\cite{vanderWaals}.
These deviations can be understood as the atoms possessing a finite size, and experiencing forces between the gas atoms 
--- this whole class of forces inter-molecular forces are now referred to as van der Waals forces.
(A fuller account of the scientific history of these forces is discussed in Parsegian~\cite{Parsegian2006}).
While a number of different inter-molecular forces due to permanant
 or fluctuating electric dipoles are possible~\cite{Israelachvili2011},
we are primarily interested in forces due to fluctuating dipoles.  
This forces are typically referred to as London forces in honor of London's work
 using quantum mechanics to compute the potential between atoms via perturbation theory~\cite{London1930}.  
The potential has a characteristic $d^{-6}$ scaling.  As a heuristic argument, one can think of
 the first fluctuating dipole generating an electric field which decays as $d^{-3}$.  This field induces another
dipole in the other molecule.  The combined effect at the original atom scales as $(d^{-3})^2$.  

In 1948 Casimir and Polder extended this theory to using Quantum Electrodynamics
(QED) to account for the retardation due to the finite speed of light~\cite{CasimirPolder1948}. 
They found that in the far-field 
(where the transition wavelengths $\omega_A$ exceed the separation of the atoms $d$, $d\gg c/\omega_A$)
the interatomic potential decays more rapidly as $d^{-7}$.  The change in power law can be 
attributed to the induced dipoles decorrelating over the time-of-flight of the virtual photon, 
and thus having a weaker interaction.  
\todo{Is this from Milonni?}
Furthermore, they found an attractive force between an atom and perfectly conducting wall, with a $d^{-3}$ scaling
in the near field (van der Waals) regime, passes over to $d^{-4}$ scaling in the far-field.
In this case the atom can be thought of as interacting with it's image in the perfect conductor,   
which leads to an attractive potential for the atom,
\begin{equation}
  V_{CP}(d) =-\frac{3\hbar c\alpha_0}{64\pi^2\epsilon_0 d^4},
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\alpha_0$ is the atom's static polarizability,
and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.  Throughout this thesis we will refer to these
atom-wall type forces as Casimir-Polder forces.  

We can now present a schematic computation of the Casimir-Polder potential, with an emphasis 
on the broad techniques, intuition, and connections to other computations~( The discussion here follows Steck~
\S{9.3} of Ref.\cite{SteckNotes}).  
This theory treats the interaction of the atoms with the light field via the interaction Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  H_{\text{int}} = -\frac{e}{mc}\hat{\vect{p}}\cdot\hat{\vect{A}}(\hat{\vect{x}}) + \frac{e^2}{2mc^2}
  |\hat{\vect{A}}(\hat{\vect{x}})|^2
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\vect{p}}$ is the quantum momentum operator for the atom, and $\hat{\vect{A}}$ is the 
quantized operator for the EM vector potential at the atom's position $\vect{r}$.  \todo{Expand field operators
$\op{A}(\vect{x},t) = \sum_k a_k e^{-i\omega_k t} f_k(\vect{x}) + \text{h.c}$}
(This interaction can instead be treated with $H_{\text{int}} = -\op{\vect{d}}\cdot \op{\vect{E}}$ where
these Hamiltonians are connected by the Power-Zienau transformation~\cite{SteckNotes}.\todo{Find page})
To find a non-zero effect one must go to second-order in perturbation theory, which leads to an atomic
energy shift to state $n$ of 
\begin{equation}
  V\subCP = \sum_{m\ne n,\vect{k}} \frac{
    |\langle E_n, 0|  H_{int}|E_m, 1_{\vect{k}}\rangle\langle E_m, 1_{\vect{k}}|  H_{int}|E_n, 0\rangle}{E_n-E_m-\hbar\omega_k},
\end{equation}
where $E_m$ are the atom's energy levels, the photon has energy $\hbar\omega_k$, 
and $\langle E_n,1_\vect{k}\rangle$ denotes the state with the atom in energy level $n$ and one photon in mode $\vect{k}$.
The shift $V\subCP$ can be understood as two transitions - from the ground state with no photons to an excited state with one photon,
and then transitioning back.  This is further summed over all possible intermediate states.
This process is represented schematically via the Feynman diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:Feynman_CP}, where 
an atom in the ground-state emits a virtual photon, and re-absorbs it.  This transition
is a ``virtual'' one, in that these intermediate states are not directly physically observable, 
but rather reflect the apparatus of quantum mechanical perturbation theory.
Note also that the photon is emitted into a mode $k$, 
where the allowed modes must satisfy the electromagnetic boundary conditions
on the surfaces of the bodies.  The resulting electromagnetic mode functions (and thus the potential)
are then sensitive to the arrangements of the bodies.  This is distinct from the case in most 
field theory calculations where the modes are described by plane waves.

\end{figure}

The Casimir-Polder energy shift can be split into a product of atomic and field pieces.  
It is often convenient for calculations to write the energy in terms of the imaginary frequency, $\omega = -is$,
since on the imaginary frequency axis, most functions are smoothly decaying real functions.
\todo{Cite Johnson for benefits?  Kramers-Kr\"onig relations.}
To linear order in the coupling, the energy can be written on the imaginary frequency $is$ as 
\begin{equation}
  V\subCP(\vect{x}) = -\frac{\hbar c}{2}\int_0^\infty ds \alpha_{jk}(is)G^{(S)}_{kj}(\vect{r},\vect{r},is),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{ij}$ is the polarizability tensor, $G^{(S)}$ is the scattering part of the EM Green
tensor~\cite{McLachlan1963, McLachlan1963a}.  The scattering part of the Green function essentially
subtracts off the vacuum EM Green function $G^{(S)}=G-G^{(0)}$ --- this is essentially renormalizing the energy
by subtracting off contributions that are independent of the bodies.  
This has the same from as a linear-response calculation~\cite{Altland2011}, finding the linear-response of the 
atom to it's interaction with the EM field.  In this case $\alpha_{ij}$ is the susceptibility of the 
atom responding to perturbations in the EM field.  
At this order of perturbation theory, the EM Green tensor is given by its classical counterpart,
which satisfies
\begin{equation}
  \nabla\times\nabla\times G(\vect{x},\vect{x'}) 
  + \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}\epsilon G(\vect{x},\vect{x'}) 
  = \omega^2\delta_{ij}\delta(\vect{x-x'}).
\end{equation}
 Evaluate at imaginary frequency. Note fully quantum theory, can account for atomic transitions.
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_{ij} = \sum_n\sum_m \frac{\langle E_n | d_i|E_m\rangle \langle E_m| d_j|E_n\rangle}{E_m-E_n}.
\end{equation}

While we have only given the linear energy shift, there are a number of higher loop contributions
which can be resummed analytically due to the relative simplicity of the expansion~\cite{Rosa2011}.  
\todo{Cite Dzyaloshinksii or papers book for resummation?}
The result of which is 
\begin{equation}
  V\subCP(\vect{r}) = \frac{\hbar c}{2\pi}\int_0^\infty ds \tr \log[I - \alpha(is) G^{(S)}(\vect{r},\vect{r})].
\end{equation}

\subsection{Forces between bodies: Casimir Energy}

The classic example due to Casimir~\cite{Casimir1948} predicts that a pair of electrically neutral,
perfectly conducting plates will attract one another due to their interaction with the quantized 
electromagnetic (EM) field.  
The presence of the conductors forces the electric field to vanish on the surfaces,
which restricts the allowed modes of the electromagnetic field, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Casimir_sketch}.
Each quantized mode of the electromagnetic field contributes
to the energy, even in the ground state with zero photons.  Each mode contributes 
$E_\alpha=\hbar\omega_\alpha/2$ , where $\hbar$ is Planck's  constant, and $\omega_\alpha$ is the frequency of the mode.
The total energy is found by summing the mode for each energy --- the total energy is
badly divergent since each term in the sum is positive.  However a finite answer can 
be found by consider an energy \emph{difference} between two different configurations.  
The subtraction to eliminate divergences is a simple form of field theoretic renormalization, 
and will be essential in computations of Casimir quantities.  
In this case, the energy when the bodies are removed to spatial infinity is subtracted.  
The renormalized energy between the plates is
\begin{equation}
  E-E_0 = -\frac{\hbar c}{240\pi^2 d^3},
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant,
and $d$ is the distance between the plates.  Note that in this expression there is no
mention of the material properties of the media --- this is an artifact of imposing Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the surfaces.  

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig/intro/twoplanes_wave}
\caption{Sketch of allowed modes between perfectly conducting plates.}
\label{fig:Casimir_sketch}
\end{figure}

The theory was extended by Lifshitz to describe forces between dielectric half-spaces~\cite{Lifshitz1956}.
The Casimir force between two dielectric half-spaces of permittivities $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2$
separated by a gap of thickness filled with permittivity $\epsilon_3$ is given by 
\begin{align}
\frac{F}{L^2} =& -\frac{\hbar}{2\pi^2c^3}\int_0^\infty d\xi \xi^3 \epsilon_3^{3/2}
\int_1^\infty dp\,p^2\bigg[ 
\frac{r\supTE_{13}r\supTE_{23}e^{-2\sqrt{\epsilon_3}p\xi d/c}}{1 - r\supTE_{13}r\supTE_{23}e^{-2\sqrt{\epsilon_3}p\xi d/c}}
+ \frac{r\supTM_{13}r\supTM_{23}e^{-2\sqrt{\epsilon_3}p\xi d/c}}{1 - r\supTM_{13}r\supTM_{23}e^{-2\sqrt{\epsilon_3}p\xi d/c}}\bigg],
\end{align}
where the electromagnetic reflection coefficients are given by 
\begin{align}
  r\supTE_{ij} & = \frac{s_i-s_j}{s_i+s_j}\\
  r\supTM_{ij} & = \frac{\epsilon_j s_i - \epsilon_i s_j}{\epsilon_j s_i + \epsilon_i s_j}
\end{align}
where 
\begin{equation}
  s_i = \sqrt{p^2 + \epsilon_i/\epsilon_3-1}
\end{equation}
following Zhou~\cite{Zhou1995}.  As intimidating as this expression is, it can be heuristically derived with
relative ease via the ``argument principle''~\cite{vanKampen1968, Zhou1995}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $E = \sum_k\frac{\hbar \omega_k}{2}$
  \item Should insert sum over transverse momenta.  This sum runs over all modes, not just frequency.
  \item Only allowed modes contribute.  
    Between two plates, the allowed modes must satisfy the Fabry-Perot criterion: 
    $\Delta = 1- r_1r_2e^{2ik_3d} =0$.
  \item Use fact that in complex analysis integrating function in closed loop in complex plane gets
    $\oint dz f(z) = 2\pi i\sum_{\text{poles} z_i}\text{Res} f(z_i)$.
  \item So energy can be written as 
    \begin{equation}
      E = \sum_k \frac{\hbar \omega_k}{2} = \oint dz \frac{\hbar z}{2(2\pi i)} \frac{\Delta'(z)}{\Delta(z)},
    \end{equation}
    where the function $\Delta'/\Delta$ is designed to have unit residue at the zeroes of $\Delta(z)$.
  \item Now integrate by parts w.r.t. $z$
    \begin{equation}
      E = \oint dz \frac{\hbar}{2(2\pi i)} \log\Delta(z).
    \end{equation}
  \item Now differentiate w.r.t $d$ to get force, and done.  
\end{itemize}
(Similar versions of this are used to derive scattering method results as well \todo{Cite correct Lambrecht paper for 2x2 matrices
in scattering formalism})

The Casimir-Polder results for interacting atoms are recovered from the Lifshitz formula by taking the limit of dilute bodies,
$\epsilon \approx 1+\alpha n$, where $n\ll 1$ is the density.  
This was further expanded on by Dzyaloshinskii~\etal\cite{Dzyaloshinskii1959,Dzyaloshinskii1961} who
showed the connection between Casimir force and the pair-wise van der Waals potentials.  
This work is reviewed by McLachlan~\cite{McLachlan1963, McLachlan1963a}.  

The theory can be extended to account for dispersion and finite temperature.  
Some care is required in quantizing the electromagnetic field within dielectric media,
since due to the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, the presence of dispersion implies dissipation.
The usual approach to open-systems in quantum mechanics is to couple the system to a reservoir, 
and then trace out, or integrate out, the reservoir.
It has been phenomenologically observed that one gets the correct answers by a direct substitution
$\epsilon(\vect{x})\rightarrow \epsilon(\omega,\vect{x})$.  This issue has in investigated in~
\cite{Barash1975,Rosa2010}, and justified by careful examination of the thermodynamic energy
and relation to the microscopic details of the medium.   

% As pointed out by Rosa~\etal~\cite{Rosa2010}\comment{right paper?}, 
% the Lifshitz theory is a classical stochastic electrodynamics theory,
% which attributes the fluctuations as thermal fluctuations of the medium.  
% \comment{Does not fit at all}
% In somewhat later activity from this school, Barash and Ginzburg further extended this work to 
% discuss the finite temperature effects, dissipation and the relation to the
% microscopic details of the medium~\cite{Barash1975}.  

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

% Like many effects in quantum mechanics, one may come up with a number of interpretations for the source
% of the Casimir effect.  

% However, boundary conditions are idealizations that ignore the structure
The Casimir effect --- like many quantum effects --- can be made to sound mysterious than it is.
The Casimir effect naturally fits into the broader context of quantum field theory.  
The Casimir effect is best thought of as a long-ranged interaction between dielectric bodies 
which interact with one another via the electromagnetic field~\cite{Jaffe2005, Rahi2009}.  
This view makes the clearest connection to the underlying physics, rather than emphasizing idealized
boundary conditions.  

One can derive this as a low energy approximation from the fundamental theory of QED.  
The material bodies are assumed to be composed on atoms and electrons, bound together via
the principles of solid state physics.  The fundamental interactions between the particles 
are electromagnetic in nature.  If we are interested in energies much lower than the binding energies
of the constituent atoms, we can neglect any changes in this structure, the bulk properties of which determine
the dielectric properties of the medium.  
The electrons comprising the body still interact with the EM field, and for low energies and weak fields
one can approximate this interaction via linear response.  
The Casimir effect can be thought of as the interaction of electrons on different bodies with one another
via the electromagnetic field.  

The dominant wavelengths for this interaction are on the order of the distance between the bodies,
and the resonant wavelengths of the bodies.  The distances between the bodies are typically much
larger than the distances between the constituent particles comprising the bodies.  As such we can treat
the bodies as composite objects described by their bulk properties.

\subsection{Distance and Energy Scales}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Casimir energy at $1\mu m$.  Take a dipole of 1 Debye.    
    Compare with 
  \item Casimir pressure  at $1\mu m$
  \item Cite Milonni for capacitance calculation.  


We can estimate typical distance scales by considering the dominant 
resonances of the medium, and the thermal wavelength.
  So the Casimir force is typically then important at distances below the
 transition wavelength which is usually around $1\mu m$.    

% \item Considering long-wavelength approximation to medium.  Typically interested in forces
%     on the micron-nanometer scale.  Above a few microns the force is too small to observe,
%     while below a nanometer the forces are too strong to reliably isolate the atom 
%     and the continuum approximation starts to break down.  

\item The typical energy scale can also be estimated.
  If we consider an atom with a static polarizability of 
$\comment{polarizability}$, at a distance of $1\mu m$, we find the Casimir-Polder potential is \ldots. 

For macroscopic bodies we can compare the Casimir energy for perfect 
metal conductors at a distance $d$ to the energy stored in the capacitance.
  Note that we compute an energy per unit area.  
\comment{Milonni makes the comparison to capacitance, \cite{Milonni1994}}

The Casimir energy per unit area is $\frac{\hbar c\pi^2}{240 d^3}$, while the voltage for a parallel plate capacitor is.
\begin{shaded}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Capacitance is $V=Q/C$.  
\item $C = \epsilon_0 A/d$.  
\item Energy is $\frac{1}{2}CV^2=\frac{Q^2}{2C} $
\end{enumerate}
\end{shaded}

\item Casimir forces are short ranged forces and decay away quickly --- for example the 
  London dispersive force between two atoms decays as $d^{-6}$.  

  For macroscopic bodies, the decay of the Casimir energy is slower, since we can roughly think of
  integrating up the contributions from all of the constituent atoms.
  For Casimir energies, the energy decays as $d^{-3}$ where $d$ is the separation of the bodies.  

In comparison
    the Coulomb potential between charged particles is behaves as $d^{-1}$,
    where $d$ is the particles separation.  

    While the Coulomb potential can be neglected for neutral atoms, 
    it is more relevant for macroscopic bodies due to 
    patch potentials.  For conducting bodies, these are fixed random distributions 
    of localized electrical charge on the surface.  For Casimir experiments, the patch potentials 
    act as a long-ranged background that must be accounted for and subtracted away to extract
    the more interesting Casimir energy.  
    


\item Since the Casimir force is a broadband phenomenon, it depends on the resonant frequencies 
    of the interacting media, such as the atomic polarizablitiies $\alpha(\omega)$ or the dielectric
    function $\epsilon(\omega)$.  Furthermore at nonzero temperature, there is a thermal wavelength,
    $\omega_T=\kB T/\hbar$.  
    Given the radiative nature of the Casimir effect, there is a factor $e^{i\omega d/c}$ weighting the 
    frequency integrals.  This contributes most when its exponent factor is order one.  
    The Lifshitz integral can be approximated in differing regimes.  

    In the near-field or van der Waals regime, the media are assumed to closer than the 
    resonant wavelength of the media $d\ll \omega_A/c,\omega_M/c$, the exponential factor 
    is unity, and each frequency contributes equally.  In essence, the interaction is an instantaneous 
    dipole interaction between the media, which inspires the name.    

    The so-called Casimir-Polder regime occurs when the atoms are much further than a resonant wavelength 
    $d\gg \omega_A/c,\omega_M/c$,
    in which case the dominant contributions come at zero frequency, and the functions can be approximated
    with their static limit.  This far-field regime typically makes the potential decays more quickly.  

    Even further away from the bodies is the thermal regime $d\sim \omega_T/c$, where the real photons excited by the 
    thermal field contribute significantly.  In this regime the field decay is typically slower as $E\sim d^{-3}$,
    the same as the near-field van der Waals regime.

\section{Summary of Casimir Experiments}
\label{sec:expt_review}
The Casimir effect has been measured in experiments, both for macroscopic bodies and atoms.
Beyond its interest as a fundamental quantum effect, the Casimir force is also important 
in designing novel physical devices for both atoms.

%Lamoreaux
\subsection{Casimir}
An early indirect measurement was liquid Helium flowing up the walls of a container.  
Lifshitz and co-workers applied the Casimir pressure to explain the phenomenon of liquid helium
flowing out of a jar.  The presence of the liquid helium crawlign up the surface reduces the Casimir energy,
so the liquid helium experiences an attractive pressure up the walls.  

While Casimir predicted an attractive force between neutral metal bodies in 1948,
it was only precisely measured in 1997 by Lamoreaux~\cite{Lamoreaux1997}.   
%Lamoreaux's work spurred a large amount of experimental and theoretical work.  
This experiment measured the Casimir force between a sphere above a metal plate,
and measured the force by detecting the change in capacitance of the arrangement.  
This landmark experiment was closely followed by measurement by Mohideen\etal\cite{Mohideen1998}
using an atomic force microscope to measure the force in a sphere-plate geometry.  
The Casimir force has also been directly measured in a nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) system 
by Chan~\etal~\cite{Chan2001}.  In this case, the Casimir force is detected by the modification it
makes to the frequency of a torsional oscillator suspended above a plate.  

The sphere-plate geometry has the experimental advantage of removing the need to carefully
align the metal plates. Given the strength of the Casimir force it is hard to keep the plates exactly parallel,
and separate, which is something that dogged early attempts to measure the Casimir force.
Despite the aforementioned difficulties, Bressi\etal measured the Casimir force between parallel plates~\cite{Bressi2002}.  
\comment{Lower precision?}

The Casimir force is also important in applications of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), 
as a source of stiction~\cite{Tas1996, Serry1998, Buks2001}.  This is particularly important
in free standing structures such as nano-oscillators.  
Given the Casimir force is an attractive potential, if parts of the device get too close to the substrate
they will permanently stick to one another, leading to device failure.  

Precisely measuring such a small force requires careful calibration of the measurements 
and removing systematic effects.  Two of the primary experimental errors are due to 
patch potentials, and surface roughness.  The patch potentials are localized surface 
charge distributions, which due to the longer range Coulomb interaction swamp the weaker
Casimir force.  Surface roughness reflects the fact the surfaces are not perfectly smooth,
and as such the exact distance between bodies is not clear.  While the roughness can be taken into
account in theory, the surface must also be carefully characterized.  Reviews of these and other 
difficulties are available from

\subsection{Casimir-Polder}
%Skip over names?  
The Casimir-Polder force has been measured in the context of atomic beams, cavity QED, and 
Bose-Einstein condensates.  

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    The first attempts at directly measuring the Casimir-Polder force used atomic beams 
    near surfaces.  
    Sukenik~\etal made the first modern attempt to measure the Casimir-Polder force~\cite{Sukenik1993}.
    Their experiment passed a hot beam of atoms through an optical cavity and attempted to detect
    the effect by the small phase-shift induced on the atoms.  Unfortunately, their measurement 
    was not definitive.
    More recent experiments by Perreault~\etal\cite{Perreault2005}, and Lonig~\etal\cite{Lonij2009} succed in measuring
    the Casimir-Polder force with atomic beams.  These experiments passed an atomic beam past grating and 
    detected the phase-shift by atom interometry.  % These experiments act as precision tests of the theory,
    % and found that the first principles calculations based on perturbation theory are less successful
    % than an effective description informed by experimental data.  

% \item Cronin \cite{Perreault2005,Lonij2009}  Atom interferometry experiments for atoms near gratings.
%   Pass hot atomic beam through gratings.  Useful as precision tests of theory.  
%   Typically find first-principles theory based on perturbation not working as well,
%   as effective descriptions which rely on experimental computations.  
\item 
    The Casimir-Polder effect has also been observed in the context of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)
    of ultra-cold atoms~\cite{Harber2005,Obrecht2007}.  The BEC allows for precise distance control,
    and can be used in atom interferometry to detect small phase shifts.    
    The atoms are confined to a harmonic trap, and can be brought near to a surface to probe the Casimir
    force.  The Casimir force acts to shift the oscillation frequency of the harmonic trap in a position
    dependent manner.  
    Furthermore, this technique was able to measure the Casimir force in the thermal regime, which
    is often difficult since the force is weak at those distance.  In this case it is easy to 
    vary the distance of the atoms from the surface from $1\mu m$ up to 10 $\mu m$ to observe
    the cross over between the Casimir-Polder and thermal regimes.

% Measured Casimir-Polder shift in Bose-condensed gas of ultra-cold atoms.
%   Harber\etal\cite{Harber2005} measured the shift in the oscillation frequency
%   of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).  BEC used for enhanced signal, well localized.
%   Casimir force not relevant to coherent aspects of BEC.
  % Obrecht\etal\cite{Obrecht2007}Also measured force in the hard to measure thermal regime.  
  % Can easily vary distance of atom from surface from $1\mu m$ up to $10\mu m$ from surface.
  % Relate to lifshitz formula and cross-over.    

\item Quantum computing devices
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Quantum computing offers to make certain computation tasks (most notably factorising 
        large prime numbers) and simulation taks much more efficient.  
      \item Large push to develop scalable quantum devices in a number of model systems
        (NV centers, cold atomic gases).  Atoms provide excellent quantum memory, internal
        states are well isolated, controllable interactions via lasers.  
      \item In order to address each atom, and ensure strong interactions, some groups 
        ar developing microscopic dielectric waveguides to allow trapping, addressing and strongly interacting with a 
        single atom in a scalable manner~\cite{Alton2011, Hung2013, Goban2014}.  
      \item In designing these new devices it is essential to compute and account for the Casimir-Polder force
        the atom's experience when brought close to the dielectric surface.  
    \end{enumerate}

    The Casimir-Polder effect is also important in the design of devices aiming to trap and interact
    with atoms near surfaces.  While ultra-cold atoms are very clean systems to work with for 
    studying and exploiting quantum effects, they are hard to minaturize and scale up.  In recent
    years there has been a concerted push to develop technology to regain the appealing features 
    of cold atoms in a scalable architecture. 
    One direction that has been pursued is the so-called atom-chip\cite{Folman2000,Schneider2003}, where atoms are 
    trapped near surfaces via a combination of lasers and magnetic fields from wires embedded in
    the surface.  The atoms are typically trapped within a micron of the surface.  
    In most applications the Casimir effect acts as a lower bound on how close bodies can be brought 
    to each other, which in turn limits the coupling strength and thus the speed of operation.  
    \comment{other work - books?}
    In addition, the Casimir force as been taken into account in design 1D atom traps 
    near a nanowire~\cite{Salem2010}.

    Another direction that has been pursued is strong coupling of atoms to light via cavity 
    quantum electrodynamics (QED).  While originally pursued with high-finesse Fabry-Perot optical
    cavities, this has since been exploring the use of dielectric waveguides

Challenges:  Need to characterize surface over broad frequency range.
Need methods with converge well for all geometries.  

\subsection{Current experimental directions}

\item Thermal casimir force

 Lamoreaux favors Drude model, Capasso/Mohideen favours plasma model.
\item Repulsion (Cite Capasso experiment with bromobenzene).  Possibility of stable trapping

\item The Casimir force is also important for speculative searches for new physics on the millimeter to micron
scale~\cite{Dimopoulos2003, Bezerra2011}.  The new physics must be shortranged, and is typically modelled as 
a Yukawa potential, $V_{\text{Yuk}}=\alpha e^{-\lambda r}/r$.  
On this scale however, the Casimir effect is the dominant interaction, and must be 
carefully subtracted in an experimental procedure.  However, one can look for deviations from the expected 
power laws, which has been used to exclude regions of the parameter space for the hypothetical
Yukawa interaction~\cite{Lamoreaux1997,Obrecht2007,Bezerra2011}.  
Experiments searching for modifications of gravity typically employ a thin gold layer over
a density modulation.  The gold layer provides a common short-ranged Casimir interaction, while the 
a density modulation allows measuring variations due to gravity~\cite{Sorrentino2009, Geraci2015}.
Given the difficulties in cleanly measuring the Casimir force, this even more ambitious program has yet 
to yield results.

\section{Computational methods for Casimir Effects}
\label{sec:numerical_review}
Although the Casimir force was explored by theorists before precision experiments were available,
the advent of precision experiments and new technologies has spurred developments in 
theoretical and computational methods.
While early work focused on highly symmetric geometries 
of bodies such as parallel planar bodies~\cite{Casimir1948} or spheres~\cite{Boyer1968}, 
current experiments require calculations for arbitrary shapes and arrangements of bodies, 
which have realistic material properties.  
This is a difficult task since the Casimir force is a broadband phenomenon, depending on the whole 
range of frequencies.  Furthermore it depends sensitively on the geometry of the bodies involved, 
and one must carefully renormalize the results.  
For a simple, symmetric geometry it is possible to write down tractable analytical expressions for
the Casimir energy based on expanding the field in mode functions.  However for general geometries 
such an expansion may not be possible, or converge well.
These requirements force one to adopt a general numerical approach to computing Casimir forces~\cite{Johnson2011}.
We will discuss three of these methods: the proximity-force approximation (PFA), the scattering
or fluctuating surface current approach, and the worldline method.  We will also review notable
calculational frameworks.  

% \begin{enumerate}
% %\item Experiments spurred development of theory.  
% % \item Prior methods relied on mode-function expansion of fields, which is only possible
% % for simple geometries.  
% % \item Theory must account for material properties.  Surface roughness.  
% % \item Need general methods, tend to result in numerical integrals.
% % \item Crudest method available is the proximity force approximation.  
% % \item Analytical theory based on green function methods.  (Russian school, McLachlan, Schwinger)
% % \item Scattering approach.  
% % \item Worldline method.  
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Proximity Force Approximation}

The proximity force approximation (PFA) is an uncontrolled approximation to
the Casimir force between generally shaped objects~\cite{Derjaguin1956}.  
The PFA treats each infinitesimal segment of the surfaces as if they were perfectly conducting planes.
The Casimir force is found under the PFA by integrating the Casimir pressure over the surfaces.
The PFA is assumed to be valid if the radius of curvature of the bodies $R$, is large relative to 
their separation $d$.  It was used by Lamoreaux to estimate the Casimir force between the sphere-plate
in his landmark experiments, where the radius of the sphere was indeed large compared to the separations explored. 

For many years the PFA was the only practical general method of estimating Casimir forces.
The PFA has the advantage of being straightforward to implement, and functions as an order of magnitude
estimate for the Casimir force for arbitrary geometries.
  However it has some prominent limitations.
  First, it is only valid for vanishing curvature.
 Second, the PFA assumes that the force can be found by integrating up
 the pair-wise Casimir forces between each pair of surface patches.  This ignores the non-additivity
of the Casimir force.  Unlike the potential between electric charges where the total potential is
the sum of the pair-wise potential energies, the Casimir force for an arrangement
of bodies is not just the sum of the pair-wise energies.~(See \S{8.2} and \S{8.4} of \cite{Milonni1994})
Finally, the PFA allows only for strictly attractive forces.  
In contrast, the Casimir force can be repulsive, albeit under difficult to engineer circumstances 
such as media with a strong magnetic response, or anisotropic media.

% \begin{enumerate}
% %\item Find first use?  Lamoreaux mentions usage.  Derjaguin?
% % \item Note problem with non-additivity. The PFA explicitly assumes that the force
% % can be found by adding up the pair-wise contributions from each surface patch.  
% % However, the Casimir force is a global phenomenon, and the total Casimir force
% % Useful if very limited curvature, or effectively approximate geometry as planar.  
% \item Only attractive.  (real electromagnetic casimir forces have possibility of 
% being repulsive, even if hard to realize in general.)
% \item ever extended to include material properties?
% \item Despite these limitations, the PFA is relatively straightforward to implement,
% and functions as an order of magnitude estimate for the Casimir force.  In the limit
% of vanishing curvature, the PFA converges to the correct Casimir force.  
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scattering Approach}

The scattering approach is currently the only general method of computing 
electromagnetic Casimir forces in general media.  The essence of the scattering method 
is encodes the presence of material bodies by the electric field they scatter.  

While originally developed as an analytical
technique, the scattering method has also been converted to an efficiency numerical method.  

It has been explored as an analytical technique,
and further converted to a form 
\begin{enumerate}
\item EM field depends on scattered field.  Encoded in reflection matrices
which are related to how EM field scatters from a given surface.  
\item Developed as analytical technique, and developed into general purpose numerical technique.
Numerous authors contributed over decades.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Developed as general method, for scattering between basis modes.  
    Initially used with analytical mode expansions.  Can also use finite element basis,
    much more adapted to arbitrary bodies.  
\item Physical picture is fluctuating currents on bodies.  Interact via EM field.
  Can use Green function as if dielectric suffused all space.

\end{enumerate}

The fluctuating-surface-current formulation is a general method for computing Casimir
energies for piece-wise continuous linear dielectric and magnetic media~\cite{Reid2009,Reid2011, Reid2013}.  
In essence the method calculates the interaction between electric and magnetic surface currents 
on different bodies, mediated by the EM field.  Mathematically this is derived 
from a path integral for the EM field, where the EM boundary conditions are enforced at the 
surfaces via functional $\delta$-functions.  The $\delta$-functions introduce fields 
bound to the surfaces, which can be interpreted as surface currents flowing to enforce boundary conditions.
After integrating out the EM field, these surface currents interact with one another via the EM
Green function.  Since the method assumes piece-wise, homogenous media and enforces EM boundary
conditions, it is the relatively simple homogenous EM Green function that appears in these expressions.
In order to discretize the method for numerical computations, a basis set to express the currents must
be chosen.  For general numerical methods, a triangular mesh is the most flexible.
The surface currents can also be formally integrated out, leaving the energy proportional 
to a functional determinant 
\begin{equation}
  E = \int_0^\infty d\xi \log\det\left[\mathbf{M}^{-1}_{\infty}\mathbf{M}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\xi$ is the imaginary frequency, 
and $\mathbf{M}$ is a matrix where the entires encode the scattering between various surface current 
elements via the homogenous EM green function,  
\begin{equation}
  M_{ab} = \int dx dy f_a(x) G_{ab}(x,y)f_b(y).
\end{equation}
The $\mathbf{M}^{-1}_\infty$ term is a renormalization that subtracts the energy as the bodies are 
arbitrarily far apart, which acts to remove the energy from any self-interactions of the bodies with themselves.

Numerically, this method comes down to computing the determinant of a large sparse matrix, which is 
an intensive operation.  If a matrix has $N$ non-zero entries, the determinant requires $\order(N^3)$ operations
\comment{N rows or N entries}.
While it is possible to parallelize computing the determinant~\cite{Beliakov2013}, 
this is somewhat involved~\comment{barf}.
However, since each frequency $\xi$ contributes independently, the integral over $\xi$ could be
trivially parallelized.

Thus far, this fluctuating surface current method is the only general method for computing 
Casimir energies in arbitrary geometries.  Furthermore, it is quite successful,
for example describing the energy dependence of nanoparticles, which would have been very difficult
with more traditional methods.  In addition, it correctly captures previous known results
for Casimir energies, such as plane-plane and sphere-plane energies.

\section{Scalar Worldline Casimir Energies}

The worldline method is an alternative method for computing Casimir energies.
  The worldline method was initially developed as an alternative method for 
carrying out QFT calculations in terms of particle 
mechanics~\cite{McKeon1993, Strassler1992,Schubert2001}.
  In particular the quantum effective actions can be computed in terms of
 the suitable dynamics of a quantum particle.
\comment{Other references - was one contemporaneous with Strassler? Bern-Kosower}

The basic insight is that for one loop effective actions, 
the field path integral calculation can be recast in terms of the particle path
 integral for particles travelling in closed space-time loops.
  This is quite similar to the scalar electrodynamics Feynman explored
 in his Ph.D thesis~\cite{Feynman1942, Brown2005}
\comment{Seems to actually be his 1950 QED paper RE Schubert2001}.
  Higher order loop calculations can also be carried out with more particles, 
and gauge fields can also be treated~\cite{Schubert2001}.
  For example, the worldline method has been used to compute relativistic
 field effects for QED such as the Lamb shift~\cite{Schmidt1995}, and as a numerical algorithm~\cite{Mazur2014}.

The worldline method is heavily based on Feynman's path integral method~\cite{Feynman1948,Feynman1965}.

Our primary interest in the worldline method is for computing Casimir energies, 
which was first used to compute scalar Casimir energies by Gies~\etal~\cite{Gies2003,Gies2006, Gies2006a}.
 While the initial work focused on the zero temperature limit, 
the worldline method has also been extended to finite temperatures~\cite{Klingmueller2008}.
  This has also been used to study the torsion of inclined planes~\cite{Weber2009},
 and planes and spheres and planes and cylinders~\cite{Weber2010, Weber2010a}.  

% We will briefly introduce the method here, and discuss the method at 
% length in Ch.~\ref{ch:scalar_worldlines}.  
Let the action for the scalar field be given by 
\begin{equation}
  S = \int_0^T dt \int d^3x \left[ (\partial_t\phi)^2-(\nabla\phi)^2-V(\vect{x},t)\phi^2\right],
\end{equation}
where $V(\vect{x},t)$ defines the surfaces of the objects we wish to compute
 the Casimir energy between.
  The potential is typically chosen to be $V(\vect{x},t)=\lambda\delta[\sigma(\vect{x})]$,
 where $\sigma(\vect{x})=0$ defines the surfaces.
  In the limit $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$ the potential enforces Dirichlet boundary conditions 
  on the surfaces of the bodies.  In certain geometries this recovers electromagnetic 
results assuming the surfaces are idealized perfect conductors.  

We can compute the partition function for the field by Wick rotating to
 imaginary time (or finite temperature), where the partition function is now given by 
\begin{equation}
  Z = \int D\phi \exp\left\{-\int_0^T dt \int d^3x 
    \left[(\partial_t\phi)^2+(\nabla\phi)^2+V(\vect{x},t)\phi^2\right]\right\},
\end{equation}
The Gaussian integration over fields can be formally carried out as a functional determinant.
  In order to compute the energy we need the logarithm of the partition function,
 and various derivatives of it.
  The end result of these manipulations is that the renormalized energy can be written as 
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{scalar}} = \frac{\hbar c}{(2\pi)^{D/2}}\int_0^\infty \frac{d\cT}{\cT^{1+D/2}}
 \int d\vect{x} \dlangle e^{-\cT\langle V\rangle} -1\drangle,
\end{equation}
where $\cT$ is the loop ``time'' and governs the extent of the loops,
 $\vect{x}_0$ is the loop starting point, $\dlangle \cdots\drangle$ denotes 
an ensemble average over closed Gaussian random walks, 
and $\langle\cdots\rangle$ denotes the average of a quantity around the loop.

Thus far the worldline method has only been developed for scalar fields, 
without direct application to electromagnetic Casimir problems, 
other than for some speculation~\cite{Aehlig2011}.
  Currently, the potentials reflect the imposition of Dirichlet boundary 
conditions on the surfaces of the bodies, rather than a physical dielectric.
   In our work we will show how to incorporate the dielectric explicitly, 
and show how in simple geometries a new version of the scalar theory applies
 to electromagnetic problems.  

Quantization of the electromagnetic field inside dielectric has been considered
 by a number of authors.  
Some care is required to handle dispersion, since the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations
 imply this also requires dissipation \comment{citation?}.  
This is typically handled by coupling the electromagnetic field to an idealized
 medium, and coupling the medium to a bath of oscillators that models
 dissipation~\cite{Huttner1992,Dung1998}.  

Bechler has carried out path integral quantization for a harmonic medium 
including dispersion, and shown agreement with previous results in terms 
of noise operators~\cite{Bechler1999}.  
The primary results were the form of the propagator, 
rather than computations exploiting the propagator.
  There has been some work attempting to develop path integral quantization of
 the field inside dielectric neglecting dispersion~\cite{Bordag1998}.
  Unfortunately, these results are hard to interpret given that the non-physical
 degrees of freedom for the field do not cleanly decouple, as opposed to the 
usual situation in free space QED.
  The primary focus here was to explore the divergence structure of the theory
 via the Heat Kernel expansion, which corresponds to the small time expansion
 of a worldline path integral.
  We choose to avoid this issue by focusing on improved scalar models, 
that also correspond to the physical degrees of freedom for the field in certain geometries.  

Others have made models in the static limit by ignoring the fluctuations in the field,
and focusing purely on the electrostatic energy.
 Similar functional determinants to worldline methods are found,
 and are evaluated explicitly using a spacial grid~\cite{Pasquali2008}.

\section{Partition Function to Worldline path integral}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Intro
We consider a scalar field coupled to a background potential $V(\vect{x},t)$.  This potential
embodies the location of the bodies we are considering.  Starting from the classical action,
we will derive the Hamiltonian for the fields, and then compute the quantum partition function.  
The partition function can be written as a path-integral, which is readily evaluated as a functional
determinant.  Ultimately we want the free energy, which can be further converted into a path integral
for a fictitious single-particle.  This single-particle path integral forms the basis of the numerical
world line method.   

\item Lagrangian - Hamiltonian
The Lagrangian for the scalar field is
\begin{equation}
  L := \int d^3x \left[ \frac{1}{2}(\partial_t\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2-V(\vect{x},t)\phi^2\right].
\end{equation}
In prior work, the potential $V(\vect{x},t)$ encodes the locations of the interacting bodies, with 
definition
\begin{equation}
  V(\vect{x}) = \lambda \sum_r \delta[\sigma_r(\vect{x}-\vect{R}_r)],
\end{equation}
    where $\lambda$ is the coupling constant, $\sigma_r(\vect{x})=0$ marks the locations of the surfaces, 
    and $\vect{R}_r$ marks the center location of each body.  The coupling constant $\lambda$ 
    is taken to infinity, which corresponds to imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the surfaces.

% The conjugate momentum to $\phi$ is given by
% \begin{equation}
%   \Pi := \frac{\delta \cL}{\delta(\partial_t\phi)} = \partial_t\phi,
% \end{equation}
%     where $\frac{\delta}{\delta f(t)}$ denotes the functional derivative w.r.t. $f(t)$.    
% The Hamiltonian can then be easily found,
% \begin{align}
%   H := \int d^3x\,\Pi\partial_t\phi -  L\\ 
%   = \int d^3x\,\bigg[\frac{\Pi^2}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2 +V(\vect{x},t)\phi^2\bigg].  
% \end{align}
% We are now in a position to quantize the field by promoting the fields to operators, 
%     $\phi\rightarrow \op{\phi}, \Pi\rightarrow\op{\Pi}$.
% The fields can be promoted to operators with equal-time commutation relations
% \begin{equation}
%   [\op{\phi}(\vect{x},t),\op{\Pi}(\vect{x'},t)] = i\hbar \delta(\vect{x}-\vect{x'}).
% \end{equation}
% In exactly analogous fashion to quantum mechanics, the overlap between states is given by 
% \begin{equation}
%   \langle \phi|\Pi\rangle = \exp\bigg[\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d^3x \phi(\vect{x})\Pi(\vect{x})\bigg].
% \end{equation}
    
    We can compute physical quantities of interest such as Casimir energies and forces
    by taking suitable derivatives of the free energy.  The free energy $\mathcal{F}=-\kB T \log Z$,
    is in turn given by the partition function $Z$.  \comment{Cite Brown, Altland-Simons}

The field partition function is 
\begin{equation}
  Z = \tr[ e^{-\beta\op{H}}] = \int d\phi \langle \phi| e^{-\beta \op{H}}|\phi\rangle,
\end{equation}
where we have evaluated the trace over the complete set of field states.  In classic path-integral
fashion the exponential operator can be split into $N$ pieces, and resolutions of the identity
in both fields and conjugate-momentum fields can be inserted between each piece.  

% \begin{align}
%   Z &= \int d\phi_0\prod_{n=1}^N d\phi_n \langle \phi_n| e^{-\Delta \beta \op{H}}|\Pi_n\rangle
%   \langle\Pi_n| \phi_{n-1}\rangle
% \end{align}

After integrating out the momentum fields, the partition function can be written as 
\item Euclidean Path integral (Generating Function) 
\begin{equation}
  Z = \int D\phi \exp\left\{-\int_0^{\hbar\beta c} d\tau \int d^3x 
    \left[ \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\tau\phi)^2+\frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2+V(\vect{x})\phi^2\right]\right\}.
\end{equation}
The functional integral over $\phi$ is Gaussian and can be formally evaluated immediately as a 
functional determinant, since the differential operator is positive operator.  
Some care is required in regularizing such infinite determinants.  
This is done in analogy with finite dimensional Gaussian integrals.  
We can consider treating the fields as only being evaluated on a finite lattice of space-time points, 
with the lattice also having a finite extent which bounds all bodies.  We will then take the limit of 
arbitrarily large volume, and lattice resolution at the end.  The gradient operators 
can be treated via their finite difference approximations, which can be thought of as sparse matrices.  

In an analogous fashion, one can formally evaluate the partition function path integral as a 
functional determinant, 
\begin{equation}
  Z \propto {\det}^{-1/2}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\partial_\tau^2-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2+V(\vect{x})\right].
\end{equation}
Note that the original computations for the worldline method stressed computing the quantum effective
action for the scalar field.  This yields essentially the same expression.  

The free energy for the interacting field can be written as 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F} = -\kB T\log Z = \frac{1}{2}\kB T \log\det[-\frac{1}{2}\partial_\tau^2-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2+V(\vect{x})].
  \label{eq:free-energy-det}
\end{equation}
As it stands this expression is divergent, however we will renormalize by subtracting off the 
same expression with the bodies removed to spatial infinity.  Physically this corresponds to 
computing energy differences between different configurations.  The renormalization also cancels off 
the constant normalization factors.  

The free energy can now be converted into a single-particle path integral via some formal 
manipulations.  First we will use the identity $\log\det A=\tr\log A$, which can be readily
verified for positive finite matrices.  
\begin{align}
  \log\det A &= \log\prod_j \alpha_j%\nonumber\\
  =\sum_j \log\alpha_j%\nonumber\\
  = \tr\log A,\label{eq:log-det}
\end{align}
    where we used the facts that the trace and determinant of a matrix are given by the sum
and product of its eigenvalues respectively. \comment{Check Kirsten/Vassilevich for better argument/citation}
Furthermore, we will use the integral representation of the logarithm,
\begin{equation}
  \log A -\log B= -\int_0^\infty \frac{d\cT}{\cT} (e^{-A\cT} - e^{-B\cT}).\label{eq:integral_log}
\end{equation}
This expression also relies on a difference of terms to cancel out divergent terms at $T=0$.  The 
earlier renormalization by subtracting off the vacuum energy provides exactly this subtraction. 

By applying Eqs.~(\ref{eq:log-det}) and (\ref{eq:integral_log}) to free energy~(\ref{eq:free-energy-det}),
 the renormalized free energy can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}-\mathcal{F}_0 = -\frac{\kB T}{2}\int_0^\infty \frac{d\cT}{\cT}
  \tr\Big[e^{-(\partial_\tau^2+\nabla^2)\cT}\big(e^{-\cT V(\vect{x})}-1\big)\Big].
\end{equation}
    


\item Worldline path integral
  \begin{equation}
    F = - \int \frac{dT}{T^{1+D/2}} \dlangle e^{-\cT\langle V\rangle} - 1\drangle,
  \end{equation}
  where $\cT$ is the loop proper time, $\langle V\rangle$ is the average of the potential around a particular loop, and $\dlangle\cdots\drangle$ denotes an ensemble average over Brownian paths.  
\item Typically take $V = \lambda\delta[\vect{x}-\sigma(\vect{x})]$, where $\sigma(\vect{x})=0$ is a function describing the surfaces.  In the limit $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$ this amounts to enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the fields at the surfaces.

% \begin{shaded}
%   The presence of $\delta(\vect{x}_N-\vect{x}_0)$ leads to an overall normalization constant $(2\pi\cT)^{-(D-1)/2}$.
%   This follows either from Hormander's argument, that 
%   \begin{equation}
%     \int d^nx\, \delta[h(\vect{x})]f(\vect{x}) = \int_{h^{-1}(0)} dS\,\frac{1}{|\nabla h(\vect{x})|}f(\vect{x}),

% where $S$ is defined as the surface satisfying $h(\vect{x})=0$, and 
% $|\nabla h(\vect{x})|=\sqrt{\sum_k \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_k}\right)^2}$.
%   In our case, we are restricting a sum of $N$ Gaussian integrals to have zero total.
%   If we define the increments $d\vect{x}_n = \vect{x}_{n+1}-\vect{x}_n$, then the loop constraint is $\delta(\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \vect{x}_k)$.
%   If we account for the remaining normalizations of the $\vect{x}_n$ integral, then the normalization for the loop path integral is $\sqrt{2\pi\Delta \cT N} = \sqrt{2\pi\cT}$.

\section{Continuous Quantum Measurements}

Describe open quantum systems, and include information from continuous measurements. 

\subsection{Quantum Trajectories}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quantum measurements are inherently probabilitistic.  
\item Thus, sequences of measurements are also inherently random.  
\item Greater experimental control means we can now probe isolated quantum systems repeatedly and see how they evolve.  
\item Move beyond simple projective measurements, which cannot describe things like position measurements.
\item To describe continuously weakly probing a system, also use stochastic processes as part of
 numerical simulation strategy.
\item Quantum tajectories correspond to monitoring a quantum system (like an atom) via a probe,
 for example shining light on the atom. \cite{Carmichael1993}
\item Simulated trajectories are possible trajectories a system could trace out as we observe.
  Also given a particular measurement record, they correspond to our best estimate of the current state of the system.

\section{Thesis outline}

The rest of this thesis is laid out as follows:  In Ch.~\ref{ch:EM_quantization} we formally quantizing
the EM field in media, and derive the worldline expressions for the electromagnetic Casimir energy.
We will carry this out both for splitting the EM field into two non-interacting scalar polarizations,
as well as the fully coupled path integral.
We will also review others work on quantizing the EM field in media.
In Ch.~\ref{ch:feynman_kac} we will discuss the general methods of solving single-particle path 
integrals.  In particular, this relies on the Feynman-Kac formula, which states the path integral
 is the solution to a diffusion equation.  In simple cases, the Feynman-Kac formula can be solved,
and we will derive those solutions for some simple planar geometries. 
In Ch.~\ref{ch:analytical} we will use the results from the previous chapter to derive analytical 
results showing agreement between the worldline method and prior results, at least for planar media.
We will also discuss the transition between high and low temperature, and near-field within the
worldline context.  
In Ch.~\ref{ch:numerical} we discuss the numerical methods for evaluating worldline path integrals
This will includes efficient methods for computing gradients, as well as Monte Carlo sampling methods
for generating paths. 
In Ch.~\ref{ch:general} we will discuss the prospects for a general method based on the current
results and examine both an approximate method coupling the two polarizations together as well
as the fully coupled path integral method.  (We will test this for a mixed geometry for which
there are other tested methods to compare the worldline method against. 
In Ch.~\ref{ch:trajectory} we change topic to discussing continuous position measurements 
of single atoms.  We will derive the quantum trajectories for this case, and develop the framework
to account for variable measurement strength, and how to reconstruct the atomic trajectory
given the output of a realistic camera.  
Finally, we will summarize our findings in the conclusion.
