\chapter{Electromagnetic Worldlines - General Results}
\label{ch:general}
There are only general ideas at this point.
There are two options- first take the gauge-theory version.
Second treat linear coupling between the variables with rotation based on the current surface normal.

In the same fashion that a path integral finds the global evolution through time by finding the correct short-time
propagator, these methods aim to find the global evolution through space by chaining together
results based on the nearest planar surface.
