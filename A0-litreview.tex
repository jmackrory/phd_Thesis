Also comments that resuls derived under limited assumptions also work at finite temperature,
 and with dissipation.  

Introduce Argument principle: $D(\vect{r},\omega)= 1-r_1r_2 e^{-2 r l}$ where $r=\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$.  
Can write sum over energies as $\sum_n \hbar\omega_n$,
 as the integral against an integral in the complex plane whose poles are at integer spacings.  
In this case, (Eq 6) there are solutions when $D=0$.  So 
\begin{equation}
E=\sum_{\alpha}\frac{\hbar\omega_\alpha}{2}=
-\frac{-1}{2\pi i} \int \frac{dk_xdk_y}{(2\pi)^2}\int_{-i\infty}^{i\infty}d\omega
 \frac{\hbar\omega}{2}\partial_\omega\ln[D(\vect{r},\omega)]
\end{equation}

Also gets used/cited by Schaden's 90s papers.

Comment on studying auxiliary system where frequency is treated as parameter.

Stress the approximation that reduces computing van der Waals forces to computing the Green function.  

Show from microscopic theory (and Maxwell's equations) that the macroscopic 
theory applies in general.
  Average interaction hamiltonian over fluctuations.
  (Similar to Milonni 2010 no?)
  Get relations involving Green tensor   Eq.(25-26)
(They use $g$ to model adiabatic turn-on/turn-off of interaction.)
\begin{equation}
\frac{\omega_n^2}{c^2}\int d\vect{r''} 
\epsilon_{il}(\vect{r},\vect{r''},i|\omega_n|,g)D_{lk}(\vect{r''},\vect{r'},\omega_n,g)
+[\nabla\times\nabla\times D]_{ik}(\vect{r},\vect{r'},\omega_n,g)
 = -\frac{4\pi}{c}\delta_{ik}\delta(\vect{r-r'})
\end{equation}
Change in free energy is 
\begin{equation}
\Delta F = -\frac{k_B T}{2\pi c}\sum_{n}'\omega_n^2\int_0^1\frac{dg}{g}\int d\vect{r'}d\vect{r}
\left[\epsilon_{il}(\vect{r},\vect{r'},i\omega_n,g)
-\delta_{il}\delta(\vect{r-r'})\right]D_{li}(\vect{r'},\vect{r},\omega_n,g)
\end{equation}

Split forces into short-range forces which depend strongly on details,
 and more universal fluctuation physics.
 They allow spatial dispersion on small scales, which is more important for short range forces.  

Eq.35 suggests a connection to QED via the polarization operator, 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{il}(\vect{r},\vect{r'},\omega_n,\zeta)=\frac{\omega_n^2}{4\pi c}
[\epsilon_{il}(\vect{r},\vect{r'},i|\omega_n|,\zeta)-\delta_{il}\delta(\vect{r-r'})]
\end{equation}
where the full green function for the EM field obeys
\begin{equation}
D = D_0+ \zeta^2D_0\Pi D
\end{equation}
(I think $\zeta$ acts to index contribution of long-wavelength photons,
 $\zeta=0$ is long-wavelength, $\zeta=1$ is all?)
So they quote a familiar looking result: 
\begin{equation}
\Delta F_{\text{long}} =-2k_BT \sum_{n}'\int_0^1 \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta}\zeta^2 \tr[\Pi D]
\end{equation}
Ok, they finally argue that the dielectric constant is dominated by short wavelength physics,
 and finally take $\epsilon_{il}(\vect{r},\vect{r'},i|\omega_n|,\zeta)=\epsilon(\vect{r},i\omega_n)\delta(\vect{r-r'})$.

Then finally show that $D$ is the full Green tensor obeying the usual macroscopic Maxwell equations.  

Just above Eq. 50 they comment that the ``simple'' theory cannot be used with the
 full/exact dielectric function, since it is itself derived as an approximation.  

Last few pages seem to be taking the near-field and far-field limits.  

Generalization to multilayer systems is easy from this point of view,
 since you just tack on more reflection coefficients.  

Comment that anisotropic systems tend to also have torque!

Also cover atom-atom forces from both the dilute limit, and also pointwise interactions.  
They also include magnetic interactions (and seem to have to allow electric-magnetic cross coupling?)

Apparently field splits into two independent scalars.  (TE/TM)
Perfectly conducting boundary conditions, so one scalar obeys Dirichlet,

  Interesting for that thought, but otherwise not relevant.  

\subsection{Emig2004}

Paper on deformations showing you can use homogenous green functions within bounding surface.  
\cite{Emig2004}

Quantize EM in general in Lorentz gauge with Fadeev-Popov gauge fixing.  
Introduce restricted partition function that ( I think) enforces EM boundary
conditions on the surfaces. (Note that this idea is exploited in Reids derivation)
\begin{equation}
Z^2(H)=\int D(A^*A)\prod_{\alpha,j}\prod_{\zeta_n}\prod_{\vect{x}\in R_\alpha}
\delta\left[\int_{\vect{x'}\in S_\alpha} \mathcal{L}^\alpha_{j\mu}(\zeta_n;\vect{x},\vect{x'})
  A^\mu(\zeta_n,\vect{x})\right]e^{-S_E[A,A^*]}
\end{equation}
where $R_\alpha$ are auxiliary surfaces, $S_\alpha$ denote surfaces.
$\mathcal{L}^\alpha_{j\mu}$ is differential operator depending on $\epsilon$, normal $\vect{n}_\alpha$.  

Boundary conditions are introduced by appeal to the extinction theorem.  
Tangential components of $B, E$ are continuous across surface.
Normal components of $B, D$ are continuous.

Treat surface constraints at functional delta functions defined on surfaces.
Use Fourier Representation of the delta.  Given quadratic  nature of path integral,
can integrate out fields.

Use Green's theorem to relate full Green function to integrals over surfaces
of of \emph{homogenous} Green functions, where $\epsilon(\omega)$ is constant.  

(Relation to Surface Integral equations?)

\subsection{Emig 2007}
\cite{Emig2007}
\comment{Note: Feinberg and Sucher extended Casimir-Polder to magnetic effects.
Should also include Haakh's work}

Ref 9 is for scalar coupled to dielectric (in terms of scattering matrices).
This is Kenneth/Klich.

Emphasizes a Schwinger like point of view, which attributes field to fluctuating
sources inside bodies.  
Focusing on gauge-invariant quantities.  

Use multipole expansion to derive quantities (Reid and others represent this
with a boundary-element method, which expands fields over surfaces.)

(This paper is the prelude to the 2009 Rahi paper.)

Physics connection to Schwinger in terms of fluctuating currents as source.
(Choice amounts to which you emphasize our integrate out first.)

\subsubsection{EM Path Integral}

Start from Lagrangian density
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} =\frac{1}{2}(\vect{E\cdot D}-\vect{B\cdot H}).
\end{equation}
Physical fields given in terms of gauge fields
\begin{gather}
\vect{E}=-\nabla\phi-\partial_t\vect{A}\\
\vect{B} = \nabla\times\vect{A}.
\end{gather}
Constitutive relations,
\begin{gather}
\vect{B}(t,\vect{x})=\int_{-\infty}^0 dt' \mur(t-t',\vect{x})\vect{H}(t',\vect{x})
\vect{D}(t,\vect{x})=\int_{-\infty}^0 dt' \epsr(t-t',\vect{x})\vect{E}(t',\vect{x})
\end{gather}
Neglecting spatial dispersion, so get local dielectric.  Also assumed to be 
isotropic.  
Assume action integral is given by up to some time $T$. (They're totally going
to go to imaginary time and temperature with this).
Fourier Expand the fields
\begin{equation}
  \vect{E}(\vect{x},t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i\omega_nT}\vect{E}(\omega_n,\vect{x}),
\end{equation}
with $\omega_n=2\pi n/T$.

The electromagnetic action is then
\begin{equation}
S(T) = \frac{T}{2}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \int d\vect{x}
\left(\vect{E_n^*}\frac{1}{\epsr}\vect{E}_n-\vect{B}_n^*\frac{1}{\mur}\vect{B}_n\right)
\end{equation}

Now use Classical equations of motion ($\nabla\times\vect{E}=-\partial_t\vect{B}$)
to eliminate $\vect{B}$ from equations.  This is all still at the classical level.
Action becomes
\begin{align}
S(T) = \frac{T}{2}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \int d\vect{x}
\left[\vect{E_n^*}\epsr\vect{E}_n-\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}
(\nabla\times\vect{E}_n^*)\frac{1}{\mur}(\nabla\times\vect{E}_n)\right]
\end{align}
Now use tensor identity manipulation, where the $k^{th}$ element of $(\nabla\times\vect{A})=$ is
\begin{align}
&\int d^3x (\nabla\times\vect{A}) \cdot f(\nabla\times\vect{B})\\
&=\int d^3x f\epsilon_{ijk}\epsilon_{imn}\partial_jA_k\partial_mB_n\\
%&=-\int d^3x A_k \epsilon_{ijk}\partial_j\epsilon_{imn} f(\partial_mB_n)\\
&=\int d^3x A_k \epsilon_{kji}\partial_j\epsilon_{imn} f(\partial_mB_n)\\
&=\int d^3x \vect{A}\cdot\nabla\times f \nabla\times\vect{B}
\end{align}
Using this integration by parts, the action can be written purely in terms of the electric field
\begin{align}
S(T) = \frac{T}{2}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \int d\vect{x}\vect{E_n^*}
\left[\epsr-\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\nabla\times\frac{1}{\mur}\nabla\times\right]\vect{E}_n
\end{align}
(Note that this paper uses relative permitivitties.) If you factor out appropriate factors of $\epsilon_0$
you get $c^2$ on magnetic/gradient term.  
This can be further decomposed as
\begin{align}
S(T) = \frac{T}{2}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \int d\vect{x}\vect{E_n^*}
\left[D -\frac{c^2}{\omega_n^2}V\right]\vect{E}_n
\end{align}
where the free space wave operator $D$, and a scattering potential $V$, are given by
\begin{gather}
D=I-\frac{c^2}{\omega_n^2}\nabla\times\nabla\times\\
V=I\frac{\omega_n^2}{c^2}[1-\epsr]-\nabla\times\left(\frac{1}{\mur}-1\right)\nabla\times.
\end{gather}
Note that $D$ has simple expressions for the Green function, since this is just the free-space
EM wave operator.  $V$ can then be treated as a perturbation and its effect solved for.

\subsubsection{Path Integrals}
This is promoted to quantum theory by using the fac that or quadratic Hamiltonians, 
the transition amplitude can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\langle \vect{E}_b|e^{-iHT/\hbar}|\vect{E}_b\rangle = \int D\vect{A} e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}S[T]}
\bigg|_{\vect{E}(t=0)=\vect{E}_a,\vect{E}(t=T)=\vect{E}_b}
\end{equation}
Note that they choose $A_0=0$ gauge-fixing.  ( I think there is an additional implicit
gauge this is fixed by this choice, or that they then use the resulting Classical equations
of motion to produce the result).  

Can get Euclidean path integral by setting $\vect{E}_b=\vect{E}_a$, and tracing over.  Then taking
$T\rightarrow -i\hbar \beta$ yields the path integral expression for the partition function
$Z=\tr[e^{-\beta H}]$ for the EM field.  

Interested in ground state energy at zero temperature.  
\begin{equation}
E=-frac{1}{\beta}\log Z
\end{equation}
Formally divergent, must be regularized.  If consider energy differences to some reference configuration,
these cutoff dependent contributions drop out.  

Renormalize by considering some reference case.
\begin{equation}
E-E_0=-frac{1}{\beta}[\log Z-\log Z_0]
\end{equation}

Rotate action from Minkowski to Euclidean, by taking $\epsilon(\omega)\rightarrow\epsilon(i\kappa_n)$
where $\kappa_n=2\pi n/(\hbar\beta c)$.  The traditional Matsubara frequencies are defined as $s_n=c\kappa_n$.
  For other gauges apparently must also rotate $A_0$.  

Exploit the facts that:
1) EM field is real, so $\vect{E}^*(\omega)=\vect{E}(-\omega)$ on the real axis.  
2) Can show response functions also obey $\epsilon(ic\kappa)=\epsilon(-ic\kappa)$.  So only need
to consider integration over $\kappa>0$.  
3) However, this means $\vect{E},\vect{E}^*$ are now treated as independent variables (?)
4) In $\beta\rightarrow \infty$ limit, replace sum with integral:
$\sum_{n\ge 0} \rightarrow \frac{\hbar c\beta}{2\pi}\int d\kappa$
So energy can be written
\begin{equation}
E = -\frac{\hbar c}{2\pi}\int_0^\infty d\kappa \log Z(\kappa).
\end{equation}

For example, the worldline method has been used to compute relativistic field effects for QED such
 as the Lamb shift~\cite{Schmidt1995}.  It has also been used as a numerical algorithm\cite{Mazur2014}.

\subsection{Feynman Path Integral for QM}

\cite{Feynman1948,Feynman1965,Brown2005}.

\subsection{Papers: Gies Worldline}

\subsubsection{Gies 2003}
\cite{Gies2003}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cite earlier paper by themselves for first worldline numerics?   Found citations for PFA.
\item Action for scalar fields.   Massive scalar field interacting with some potential $V(x)$.
  $V$ has dimensions of mass-squared.  (Field theory units $\hbar=c=1$, so $E=mc^2$)
\begin{equation}
\cL = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu\phi\partial^\mu\phi +\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2+\frac{1}{2}V(x)\phi^2
\end{equation}
\item Complete unrenormalized quantum effective action for $V$ (integrate out fields $\phi$) is 
\begin{align}
  \Gamma[V] &=\frac{1}{2}\tr\ln \left[ \frac{-\partial_\mu\partial^\mu +m^2 + V(x)}
    {-\partial_\mu\partial^\mu +m^2}\right]\\
&   =-\frac{1}{2}\int \frac{d\cT}{\cT} \int d^D x \left\{ 
\langle x|e^{-\cT[-\partial_\mu\partial^\mu +m^2 + V(x)]}|x\rangle -\frac{e^{-m^2 \cT}}{(4\pi \cT)^{D/2}}\right\}
\end{align}
Working in $D=d+1$ euclidean space-time dimensions.  
\item Convert matrix element to path integral.  
\begin{equation}
  \int d^D x \langle x|e^{-\cT[-\partial^2+V(x)]}|x\rangle = \int d^D x_{\text{CM}} \mathcal{N}\int_{x(0)=x(\cT)}Dx e^{-\int_0^\cT d\tau \dot{x}^2/4}
\end{equation}
Comments: Fix normalization from limit of zero potential (which is evaluated in momentum basis), and note that choice to drop factors of 2 has left them with an extra $\sqrt{2}$ in the definition  of the loops.
\begin{align}
\langle x| e^{\partial^2T}|x\rangle &= \int d^Dp\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{D/2}} e^{-p^2T}\langle x|p\rangle\langle p|x\rangle\\
&= \frac{1}{(4\pi \cT)^{D/2}}\\
&=\cN \int_{x(0)=x(\cT)}Dx \exp\left\{-\int_0^\cT d\tau \left[\frac{\dot{x}^2}{4}+V(x_{\text{CM}}+x(\tau)\right]\right\}
\end{align}
\item Now interpret path integral as Gaussian integral/ensemble average over closed loops.  
\begin{equation}
\cN \int_{x(0)=x(\cT)}Dx \exp\left\{-\int_0^\cT d\tau \left[\frac{\dot{x}^2}{4}+V(x_{\text{CM}}+x(\tau)\right]\right\} = \frac{1}{(4\pi \cT)^{D/2}}\dlangle e^{-\int_0^\cT d\tau V[x_{\text{CM}}+x(\tau)]}\drangle
\end{equation}
Also use scaled loops: 
\begin{equation}
x_\mu(\cT t) = \sqrt{\cT}y_\mu(t),
\end{equation}
where $t\in [0,1]$, and we view $\cT$ as a parameter.  
\item Plugging in path representation
\begin{align}
\Gamma[V]=&-\frac{1}{2 (4\pi)^{D/2}}\int_{1/\Lambda^2}^\infty \frac{d\cT}{\cT^{1+D/2}} e^{-m^2\cT}\int d^Dx_{\text{CM}} \\
&\times\dlangle e^{-\cT\int_0^1dt V[x_\text{CM} +\sqrt{\cT}y(t)]}-1 \drangle
\end{align}
For time independent backgrounds use $\int dx_0 = L_{x_0}$ as ``length'' in time direction.  \comment{For partition function version Get $\beta\hbar c$ instead.}
\item \textbf{Renormalization}
Consider field theoretic renormalization (I think whereby an analogue of the Integral Trajectory Matching formalism fixes the unknown(divergent) values at some known scale - typically from a low energy experiment).  
\item Heat Kernel Expansion \comment{Cite Gilkey} .  Expand to non-diverging order to regularize UV divergences.  Each power of $V$ amounts to an external leg.  Get a Tadpole $T^{-D/2}\int dx_0 V$, and 
\item Ignore self-energies and focus on interaction energies (which are insentitive to Field theoretic divergence)
\begin{equation}
E_\text{int}= E_{V_1+V_2+\cdots}- E_{V_1} - E_{V_2}-\cdots
\end{equation}
Can carry out renormalization at loop level and thus avoid divergent sums.  
\item They note that this emphasis on interaction energy is \emph{not} a renormalization procedure.  It circumvents that for multiple bodies.  However for isolated bodies (sphere self-stress), one must specify all of the renormalization conditions, and your answers may depend on the procedure used.
\item \textbf{Numerics}
Introduce some methods (most of which are useless).
Important method is the v-loop.  An exact diagonalization of the Gaussians, under the loop closure constraint.  Note that they choose their loop constraint to be $\int d\tau y_\mu(\tau) =0$.  This amounts to making the center of mass of the loop centered on $x_\text{CM}$.  In contrast, our work has typically used $x(0)=x(\cT)=0$.  

The ``v-loop'' algorithm amounts to considering the probability measure,
\begin{equation}
P(\{x_k\}) =  \delta(x_N-x_0)\prod_{j=0}^{N}e^{-\frac{(x_{j+1}-x_j)^2}{2\Delta T}},
\end{equation}
and completing the square in the exponents to decouple the Gaussians.  
Note their version uses $\sum_{j}x_j=0$ to fix $y_N$.  
The Jacobian can be shown to unity, since the matrix is upper diagonal, with unit diagonal.  
\item \textbf{Tests}
\item Compare to parallel plate energy to get convergence. 
\item Give some consideration to finite $\lambda$ in potential.  
\begin{equation}
V(x) = \lambda\int_{\Sigma}d\sigma \delta(x-x\sigma)
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma$ is a $d-1$ dimensional surface, $\sigma$ is a reparameterization invariant measure and $x_\sigma$ points to the surface.  
\item For interaction energies, need $(e^{-V_{1+2}} - 1) -  (e^{-V_1}-1) - (e^{-V_{2}}-1)$.  If only touch one surface (of disconnected bodies) then 
no contribution, since $V_{1+2}=V_1$
\item Then consider massless scalar between sphere/plate and cylinder plate.  
\item Consider breakdown of PFA as function of separation $a$ to sphere radius $R$.  
\item \textbf{Conclusions}
\item Needs no underlying symmetry.  Precision hinges on loop parameters chosen (and presumably discretization of surfaces)
\item Claim their delta potentials are ``hard''.
\item Note finite temperature and roughness required.  
\item Note numerical differentiation to get force is hard, but derivative can be done right off the bat.  (And energy-momentum tensors)
\item Cite Feinberg and Sucher for possible path for EM quantization.  
\end{itemize}

\section{Quantization in dielectric}


\subsection{Rosa2010}

Justifies/derives why it is okay to use neglect dispersion in derivations
of the Casimir energy.  i.e. okay to set things up with real $\epsilon$,
then take $\epsilon\rightarrow\epsilon(i\omega_n)$.  \cite{Rosa2010}

The classical energy density in a dispersive medium is (Eq. 1)
\begin{equation}
  \bar{u}(\vect{r},\omega) = 
  \left[\frac{d(\omega\epsilon_R)}{d\omega}|\vect{E}_\omega(\vect{r})|^2 +
    \frac{d(\omega\mu_R)}{d\omega}|\vect{H}_\omega(\vect{r})|^2\right],
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_R,\mu_R$ are the real parts of the permittivity and magnetic 
permeability.  This is neglecting dispersion. 
Apparently this also holds in the quantum theory, at finite temperature,
with or without dispersion \emph{in uniform media}.  
(They note relation to Barash and Ginzburg)

Use harmonic model and carefully add up contributions from each dipole.
Define energy based on integral of Poynting's theorem.
