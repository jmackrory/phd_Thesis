\begin{itemize}
\item Extend scalar worldlines to Electromagnetism.
\item Worldline is path integral method of computing energy based on following space-time trajectory of particle.  
\item Cover background on path integrals, field quantization, and Feynman-Kac formulae as solutions to path integrals.
\item Show EM field decomposed into two scalar fields, which correspond to polarizations of field. 
\item Compute energies from partition function, at zero and finite temperature.  Show analytical results for two-plane and atom-plane.  
\item Present numerical methods and results for previous cases.  Examine convergence properties and derive improved algorithms.
\item Discuss attempts at general method.
