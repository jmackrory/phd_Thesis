\acknowledge{
First I would like to acknowledge my advisor, Daniel Steck.  All of the work in this thesis was undertaken in close collaboration with him.  

Next I would like to acknowledge our collaborators, Tanmoy Bhattacharya and Kurt Jacobs.  Kurt colloborated with us on the non-uniform quanutm measuremnts paper which forms one of the key components In particular Tanmoy  has provided both the basic ground for us starting on the worldline Casimir project in explaining path integrals and the novel techniques involved in the worldline path integrals.  In addition he has proven a great  oracle for new ideas in Monte-Carlo methods, and skeptical tests of some of our more outlandish ideas.  

I would like to thank my lab-mates, Jeremy Thorn, Elizabeth Sch\"oene, Erin Cook, Paul Martin, Wes Erickson, and Richard Wagner.  
We have had many discussions that have helped me understand the travails of experimental physics.  In addition they have joined in many discussions about my work contained within, and helped me clarify my explanations, and provided companionship outside the lab. Their feedback on this thesis has also been invaluable.  

Finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend Erin Mondloch for her emotional support throughout this project and particularly during the writing phase.
