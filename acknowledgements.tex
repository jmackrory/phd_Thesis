\acknowledge{
  First, I would like to acknowledge my advisor, Daniel Steck.
  All of the work in this thesis was undertaken in close collaboration with him.
  Much of my understanding of stochastic processes and quantum trajectories 
  has come from studying his notes, ``Quantum and Atom Optics'', as the copious references reflect.
  We've both certainly learned a lot of quantum field theory and new stochastic techniques as this has 
  proceeded.  
    
Next I would like to acknowledge our collaborators, Tanmoy Bhattacharya and Kurt Jacobs.
Kurt colloborated with us on the non-uniform quantum measurements paper which forms one of the key components of this thesis.
  In particular Tanmoy has provided both the basic ground for us starting on the worldline 
Casimir project in explaining path integrals and the novel techniques involved in the worldline path integrals.
  In addition he has proven a great oracle for new ideas in Monte-Carlo methods,
 and skeptical tests of some of our more outlandish ideas.  

I would like to thank my lab-mates, Jeremy Thorn, Elizabeth Sch\"oene, Erin Cook, Paul Martin,
 Wes Erickson, and Richard Wagner.  In particular, Jeremy developed the camera model used in the chapter 
on quantum measurement.
  In addition they have joined in many discussions about my work contained within, 
and helped me clarify my explanations, and provided companionship outside the lab.
 Their feedback on this thesis has also been invaluable.

Finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend Erin Mondloch for her emotional support throughout
 this project and particularly during the writing phase.  

I would also like to acknowledge the financial support of the University of Oregon Physics Department
over the years.
