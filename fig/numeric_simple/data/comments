TM_scalingN computed the birth-death code using recursive subroutines.
These use a much larger amount of memory, around N^2 since every fork must be stored, along with computation parameters that must be passed along.

I think this is what leads to the spike upwards in computation time towards the end?

Plots of interest: computation time, scaling with N and absolute discrepency 
on log-scales.
